# Qt native, it's not a Crystal `Fiber`.

# We create the application and a simple label for display
qApp = Qt::Application.new
counter_label = Qt::Label.new("Hey, watch this!  You want to!  Really!")
counter_label.window_title = "Tick Tock"

# Connect to the timeout signal, which is emitted every interval tick
timer.on_timeout do
  counter += 1
  counter_label.text = "You've been staring for #{counter} seconds."
end

# We'll go with an interval of a second.  `Time::Span` is mapped, so you should
# feel right at home with this:
timer.start(1.seconds)

# And now, start it!
